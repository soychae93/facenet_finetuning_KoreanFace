# FaceNet - Korean Faces Fine-tuned Version

This is a fork of the original [FaceNet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) repository, fine-tuned using Korean face datasets to improve performance on Korean facial recognition tasks.

## üîç Motivation

The original FaceNet model was trained primarily on Western face datasets. As a result, performance on Korean faces (and more broadly, East Asian faces) is suboptimal. This repository fine-tunes the pretrained FaceNet model on a curated dataset of Korean faces to enhance recognition accuracy in this demographic.

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Changed

- Fine-tuned the pretrained FaceNet model using a Korean face dataset.
- Updated training scripts to support additional preprocessing options (e.g., alignment method tuned for East Asian landmarks).
- Evaluated fine-tuned model performance on Korean datasets.

## üîÅ Evaluation with New Data

### üß© 1. Align Your Dataset Using MTCNN

This step crops the faces from new images using MTCNN:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

export PYTHONPATH=/home/schae/lsmm_proj/facenet-master/src
for N in {1..4}; do \
python /user/facenet-master/src/align/align_dataset_mtcnn.py \
/user/facenet-master/datasets/lfw/K-face_mtcnn/ \
/user/facenet-master/datasets/K-face_160 \
--image_size 160 \
--margin 32 \
--random_order \
--gpu_memory_fraction 0.25 \
& done

To evaluate the fine-tuned model on a new dataset, use the following command:

#!/bin/bash

python3 src/validate_on_newfaces.py \
    /home/user \
    /home/facenet-master/finetuned_models/20200517-21222 \
    --distance_metric 1 \
    --use_flipped_images \
    --subtract_mean \
    --use_fixed_image_standardization \
    --lfw_pairs /home/jspark/Downloads/pairs_user.txt \
    --lfw_batch_size 78 \
    --lfw_nrof_folds 2

To load results, use the following command:
#!/bin/bash
python3 load_result.py\

*Please update the directory paths (/user/...) according to your environment.

## üìä Performance
The fine-tuned FaceNet model demonstrates excellent performance on Korean face:

verification tasks:
## üìä Evaluation Results: Pre-trained vs. Fine-tuned Model
- **Subgroup**: Evaluation metrics computed on **specific subsets of images**, such as those containing variations in **accessories** (e.g., sunglasses, glasses), **clothing**, or **viewpoint angle**. 
- **Total**: Evaluation metrics computed on the **entire dataset**, representing the model's **overall face recognition performance** without separating by condition.

The improvement in both subgroup and total metrics after fine-tuning indicates that the model not only performs well in general, but also maintains high accuracy across challenging face conditions (e.g., occlusion or appearance changes).

These results suggest the model is highly effective for Korean facial recognition scenarios.
