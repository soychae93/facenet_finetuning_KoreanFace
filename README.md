# FaceNet - Korean Faces Fine-tuned Version

This is a fork of the original [FaceNet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) repository, fine-tuned using Korean face datasets to improve performance on Korean facial recognition tasks.

## üîç Motivation

The original FaceNet model was trained primarily on Western face datasets. As a result, performance on Korean faces (and more broadly, East Asian faces) is suboptimal. This repository fine-tunes the pretrained FaceNet model on a curated dataset of Korean faces to enhance recognition accuracy in this demographic.

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Changed

- Fine-tuned the pretrained FaceNet model using a Korean face dataset.
- Updated training scripts to support additional preprocessing options (e.g., alignment method tuned for East Asian landmarks).
- Evaluated fine-tuned model performance on Korean datasets.

## üèÜ Results

> üìà **Fine-tuning with Korean facial data significantly improved model performance**, especially for faces with occlusions (e.g., glasses, sunglasses) or varied viewpoints.
>
> ‚úÖ **Overall accuracy improved from 74.6% to 93.0%**  
> ‚úÖ **Subgroup accuracy (e.g., glasses/clothing/angles) improved from 78.3% to 95.6%**  
> ‚úÖ **False acceptance rate (FAR) decreased by over 75%**

### üìù Notes on Categories

- **Subgroup**: Evaluation metrics computed on **specific subsets of images**, such as those containing variations in **accessories** (e.g., sunglasses, glasses), **clothing**, or **viewpoint angle**.  
- **Total**: Evaluation metrics computed on the **entire dataset**, representing the model's overall recognition performance.
